##### For the opening post of his site, I would like to discuss what inspired me to create it: the changing geopolitics under climate change. Nations are increasingly confronted with the effects of heat, flooding, extreme events, unreliable seasons, and more effects. That this is already having an effect on international relations is clear. However, I would argue that this effect is not studied (or taken seriously by most) to the degree that is necessary.

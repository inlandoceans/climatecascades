## Cosmic origins

Only relatively recently have scientists begun to mine comets and asteroids for the clues they offer to the solar system’s history. The age of small-body exploration began in 1986, when an international fleet of robotic spacecraft encountered the famous Halley’s comet as it made its most recent pass by the sun. Observations of Halley began to focus much more deserved attention on the long-neglected smaller bodies of the solar system.

“They’ve been overlooked as if they’re bread crumbs and what the world is about is the bread,” says planetary scientist Lindy Elkins-Tanton of Arizona State University in Tempe. “But they all have their own stories to tell.”

Those stories have already begun to complicate the simplest pictures of the origins of life, the Earth and the solar system. Probes of Halley, for instance, showed that the comet contained a large number of organic molecules, suggesting that at least some of the basic ingredients of life had been around since before our world existed. Earth-based instruments had previously detected only relatively simple molecules such as carbon dioxide, cyanide and hydroxide in comets as they passed by our planet[1](https://kind-torvalds-a90d39.netlify.app/feature/f-the-world-ahead#fn-1).

Such findings enrich scientist’s standard account of the solar system’s formation, in which a gigantic cloud of gas and dust collapsed into a swirling disk 4.5 billion years ago. (That collapse was possibly triggered by a shock wave from a nearby supernova explosion, which might have swept through our local region of space and destabilized the gas and dust cloud.) Gravity compacted and warmed the disk’s center, forming a sphere with enough internal pressure to kick off fusion reactions and ignite the early sun. Matter farther out clumped together and collided, forming larger objects.

Parts of the disk closest to the protostar were heated and lost most of their water; the remaining material coalesced into rocky planets (including the Earth) and stony asteroids. Ices, made of water, ammonium ion and methane, remained in the frozen outer regions, eventually being incorporated into snowy comets and larger planets.[2](https://kind-torvalds-a90d39.netlify.app/feature/f-the-world-ahead#fn-2)

Since Halley, various other missions have indicated the need to further revise this basic picture of our origins. In 2006, for example, NASA’s Stardust spacecraft delivered microscopic dust grains gathered from the atmosphere of comet Wild 2 to researchers on Earth. Cometary scientists expected Wild 2 to contain mainly interstellar material preserved from before the sun was born, since icy comets are thought to have formed in the distant reaches of the solar system, untouched by our central star’s fiery influence. Those comets should therefore contain some of the most pristine and primitive samples in the solar system.

But when analyzed, all grains a micrometer and larger turned out to have chemical signatures suggesting they formed inside the solar system after the sun’s birth. Rocky fragments found in the samples could have been created only close to the sun at temperatures exceeding a blistering 1,700 degrees Celsius.

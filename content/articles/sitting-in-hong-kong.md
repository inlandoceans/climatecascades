Hong Kong can be a difficult place to sit. The metro stations and shopping malls have little to no places to sit. Hong Kong is a place of hostile architecture, it does not want you to stop but keep walking and walking, buying and buying. Sitting in Hong Kong is usually designated towards the numerous ‘sitting out areas’ in Hong Kong, somewhat bizarre areas usually next to a road where people can sit. Rather than something out of a human concern they seem more of an after thought, a place to stash the elderly out of sight while the young go shopping. In older neighborhoods where the streets still belong to the people will place seats outside to reclaim some part of public space.

Causeway Bay smoke break

There is something fascinating about people taking smoke breaks in office areas, the contrast between the grimy alleys and the suit wearing office workers.

Market in Kowloon City

There is a festive feeling to this photo. The yellow of the fruit and the women blending in with her red jacket and orange backpack.

Spare time in Mong Kok

When there is nothing to do you look at your phone. What consequences will this if we live in a society where the mind is no longer let to wander?

## The Arctic

The **Arctic** ([/ˈɑːrktɪk/](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:IPA/English "Help:IPA/English") or [/ˈɑːrtɪk/](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:IPA/English "Help:IPA/English"))[\[1\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arctic#cite_note-ahd-1)[\[Note 1\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arctic#cite_note-3) is a [polar region](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polar_regions_of_Earth "Polar regions of Earth") located at the northernmost part of [Earth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth "Earth"). The Arctic consists of the [Arctic Ocean](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arctic_Ocean "Arctic Ocean"), adjacent seas, and parts of [Alaska](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alaska "Alaska") ([United States](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States "United States")), [Canada](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada "Canada"), [Finland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finland "Finland"), [Greenland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenland "Greenland") ([Denmark](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Danish_Realm "Danish Realm")), [Iceland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iceland "Iceland"), [Norway](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norway "Norway"), [Russia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia "Russia"), and [Sweden](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sweden "Sweden"). Land within the Arctic region has seasonally varying snow and [ice cover](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sea_ice "Sea ice"), with predominantly treeless [permafrost](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Permafrost "Permafrost") (permanently frozen underground ice) containing [tundra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tundra "Tundra"). Arctic seas contain seasonal [sea ice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sea_ice "Sea ice") in many places.

The Arctic region is a unique area among Earth's ecosystems. The cultures in the region and the Arctic [indigenous peoples](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indigenous_peoples "Indigenous peoples") have adapted to its cold and extreme conditions. Life in the Arctic includes [zooplankton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zooplankton "Zooplankton") and [phytoplankton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phytoplankton "Phytoplankton"), fish and [marine mammals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marine_mammal "Marine mammal"), birds, land animals, plants and human societies.[\[3\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arctic#cite_note-4) Arctic land is bordered by the [subarctic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subarctic "Subarctic").

## Climate

_Main articles:_ [_Climate of the Arctic_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_of_the_Arctic "Climate of the Arctic") _and_ [_Global warming in the Arctic_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_warming_in_the_Arctic "Global warming in the Arctic")

The Arctic is characterized by cold winters and cool summers. Its precipitation mostly comes in the form of snow and is low, with most of the area receiving less than 50 cm (20 in). High winds often stir up snow, creating the illusion of continuous snowfall. Average winter temperatures can go as low as −40 °C (−40 °F), and the coldest recorded temperature is approximately −68 °C (−90 °F). Coastal Arctic climates are moderated by oceanic influences, having generally warmer temperatures and heavier snowfalls than the colder and drier interior areas. The Arctic is affected by current [global warming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_warming "Global warming"), leading to [Arctic sea ice shrinkage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_change_in_the_Arctic "Climate change in the Arctic"), diminished ice in the [Greenland ice sheet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenland_ice_sheet "Greenland ice sheet"), and [Arctic methane release](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arctic_methane_release "Arctic methane release") as the [permafrost](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Permafrost "Permafrost") thaws.[\[9\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arctic#cite_note-10) The melting of Greenland's ice sheet is linked to polar amplification.[\[10\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arctic#cite_note-11)

Due to the poleward migration of the planet's isotherms (about 56 km (35 mi) per decade during the past 30 years as a consequence of global warming), the Arctic region (as defined by [tree line](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tree_line "Tree line") and temperature) is currently shrinking.[\[11\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arctic#cite_note-12) Perhaps the most alarming result of this is Arctic sea ice shrinkage. There is a large variance in predictions of Arctic sea ice loss, with models showing near-complete to complete loss in September from 2035 to some time around 2067.[\[12\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arctic#cite_note-13)[\[13\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arctic#cite_note-14)
